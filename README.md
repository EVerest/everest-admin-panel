# EVerest Admin Panel

## Introduction

The EVerest Admin Panel is a beta-stage frontend tool designed for graphically
editing the EVerest configuration file and controlling or restarting the
EVerest process.
It provides a user-friendly interface for managing EVerest instances and
includes a simulator for experimenting without an actual EVerest instance.

## Features

- **Edit EVerest Configuration Files**: Easily modify your EVerest
  configuration directly from the admin panel.
- **Connect to Multiple EVerest Instances**: Manage multiple instances from a
  single interface.
- **Simulator**: Experiment and learn without the need for a live EVerest
  instance.
- **Restart EVerest**: Restart your EVerest instance with the click of a
  button.

## Demo

We continuously deploy the latest version of the admin panel to
GitHub Pages: [Demo](https://everest.github.io/everest-admin-panel/main).
This allows you to try out the admin panel without having to install it
locally.

For every pull request we deploy a version to
`https://everest.github.io/everest-admin-panel/pr-<PR_NUMBER>` so you can test
the changes before a pull request is merged.

## Development

1. Ensure you have `pnpm` installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
pnpm install
```

- For development purposes, run:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will start the development server, making the admin panel accessible on
`localhost:8080`.

- To build the project, run:

```bash
pnpm build
```

- To preview the build result, run:

```bash
pnpm preview
```

For instructions on setting up an EVerest instance, refer to the
[EVerest Quick Start Guide](https://everest.github.io/nightly/general/03_quick_start_guide.html).
This is recommended if you're not using the simulator version.

### Releasing a new version

To release a new version, follow these steps:

1. Generate a changelog using [cocogitto](https://github.com/cocogitto/cocogitto): `cog changelog vX.Y.Z..HEAD`. Copy it.
2. Update the version in `package.json`.
3. Commit the changes, the commit message should look like this: `chore(release): vX.Y.Z`.
4. Create a new tag with the version number: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z`. Use the changelog as the tag message.
5. Push the changes and the tag: `git push origin main --follow-tags`. For this you need to have the necessary permissions.
6. The CI will automatically create a GitHub release. Add the changelog to the release description.

### Updating the simulator data

Find a detailed guide on how to update the simulator data [here](src/modules/evbc/simulator-sample-data/README.md).

### Updating config/interface-schemas

The admin panel relies on definitions of json/yaml scehams in github.com/EVerest/everest-framework to correctly parse configs. If the schemas are outdated:

1. Change the release tag in `schemas.config.ts`
2. Delete locally fetched schemas: `rm public/schemas/*.json`
3. Run `pnpm build` to fetch schemas (after `pnpm install` if you didn't setup the project already)
4. You will get an error like this: `Error: Schema hash mismatch for https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EVerest/everest-framework/v0.20.2/schemas/config.yaml. Expected: 8b548f1b5ed6a29a04fd30ca344850bc8e8f2c132063cc4422e94e1108b93e9b, got: 8b548f1b5ed6a29a04fd30ca344850bc8e8f2c132063cc4422e94e1108b93e9a`. Copy the hash and paste it in `schemas.config.ts` in the appropriate place.
5. Run `pnpm build` again. It should now be successful ðŸŽ‰
